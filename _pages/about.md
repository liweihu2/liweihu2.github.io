Hi, I'm Liwei Hu (胡立伟).

I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/liwei.hu2/en), where I previously earned my B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics.

My research focuses on inverse problems and parameter estimation governed by physical models, with particular attention to identifiability, regularization, and uncertainty quantification. 

During my PhD, I worked on interdisciplinary challenges in geoscience, including the recovery of hidden geometric structures from surface observations. This work led to collaborations with geophysicists, engineering geologists, and other mathematicians, including research visits at UC Berkeley and Case Western Reserve University.

I am broadly interested in developing mathematically rigorous and computationally scalable frameworks for inverse problems arising in complex physical systems.
