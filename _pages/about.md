I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics working on inverse problems governed by physical models, with applications to Earth surface processes.

My research investigates identifiability, regularization strategies, and uncertainty quantification in ill-posed problems constrained by partial differential equations. I am particularly interested in the recovery of hidden geometric structures from sparse and noisy data.

During my PhD, I have carried out international research collaborations, including visits at UC Berkeley and Case Western Reserve University.
