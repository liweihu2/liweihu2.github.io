I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Bologna.

My research focuses on inverse problems, regularization methods, and uncertainty quantification, with applications to Earth surface processes. I am particularly interested in identifiability, ill-posedness, and PDE-constrained optimization.

My work aims to develop methodological tools that extend beyond a single application domain, bridging applied mathematics and geoscience.

During my PhD, I have carried out international research collaborations, including visits at UC Berkeley and Case Western Reserve University.
