Hi, I'm Liwei Hu (胡立伟).

I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/liwei.hu2/en), Italy, where I previously earned my B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics.

My [research](https://liweihu2.github.io/research/) focuses on the development of mathematical methods for parameter estimation and inverse problems in physics-based models, with current applications to Earth systems.

In my doctoral research, I developed and analyzed structure-aware regularization frameworks for inferring subsurface structures from indirect surface measurements. This work led to interdisciplinary collaborations and research visits to UC Berkeley and Case Western Reserve University.

I am broadly interested in advancing mathematically rigorous and computationally scalable frameworks for inference in complex physical systems.
