Hi, I'm Liwei Hu (胡立伟).

I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/liwei.hu2/en), Italy, where I previously earned my B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics.

My research focuses on inverse problems and parameter estimation governed by physical models, with particular attention to identifiability, regularization, and uncertainty quantification. 

During my PhD, I developed and analyzed inverse problem methodologies for geoscience applications, particularly the recovery of hidden geometric structures from surface observations. This led to collaborations with geophysicists, engineering geologists, and fellow mathematicians, as well as research visits to UC Berkeley and Case Western Reserve University.

I am broadly interested in advancing mathematically rigorous and computationally scalable frameworks for inverse problems arising in complex physical systems.
