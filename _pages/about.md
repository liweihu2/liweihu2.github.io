Hi, I'm Liwei Hu (胡立伟).

I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics working on ill-posed inverse problems governed by physical models, with applications to Earth surface processes.

My research investigates identifiability, regularization strategies, and uncertainty quantification in ill-posed inverse problems constrained by partial differential equations. I am particularly interested in the recovery of hidden geometric structures from sparse and noisy data. 

While my current applications focus on Earth systems, the underlying mathematical structures extend to a broader class of inverse problems in science and engineering.

During my PhD, I have carried out international research collaborations, including visits at UC Berkeley and Case Western Reserve University. My long-term goal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally scalable frameworks for inverse problems arising in complex physical systems.
