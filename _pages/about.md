Hi, I'm Liwei Hu (胡立伟).

I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/liwei.hu2/en), Italy, where I previously earned my B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics.

My [research](https://liweihu2.github.io/research/) focuses on the development of mathematical methods for parameter estimation and inverse problems in physics-based systems, with current applications to Earth systems.

In my doctoral research, I developed and analyzed methodological frameworks for inferring subsurface geometries from surface measurements. This led to collaborations with geophysicists, engineering geologists, and fellow mathematicians, as well as research visits to UC Berkeley and Case Western Reserve University.

I am broadly interested in advancing mathematically rigorous and computationally scalable frameworks for inference in complex physical systems.
